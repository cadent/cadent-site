<div class="top-intro">
	Cadent Design is a single-owner independent design agency available for small- to large-scale projects on a contract or retainer basis. With a BA in Design and more than ten years of wide-ranging web design and development experience, I have cultivated a broad skill set along with the instincts to effectively utilize the latest available tools to fulfill an extensive variety of projects. As my work is reliant on evolving technology I understand its essential role, but my experience has also given me a well-honed appreciation for the importance of the message behind the mechanics, as well as a clear recognition of the value of clarity and consistent representation. I understand my role as a strategic link between your goals and your customersâ€™ needs, and I work to build consistent quality, ongoing viability, and future opportunity into every project I take on. Examples of my past work are here as an introduction, but I would be happy to sit down with you to discuss what I can offer for your upcoming projects.
