	Periscopic, a Portland design agency, hired me to implement a complex data visualization application theyâ€™d designed, whose purpose was to provide multiple ways to view and sort sockeye salmon spawning data for the past 60 years. I came in as lead architect directing a small team of internal developers and developed the Flex architecture and most of the core components of the piece, including a graph able to handle and aggregate hundreds of data lines and a modeling feature using a physics-heavy exploration view of the data. I also handled the internal navigation, deep linking, and the loading of smaller Flash elements. The application went on to win an award from Communication Arts and was a finalist at the Adobe MAX Awards.
