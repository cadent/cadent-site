I came in as lead architect directing a small team of internal developers and developed the Flex architecture and most of the core components of the piece, including a graph able to handle and aggregate hundreds of data lines and a modeling feature using a physics-heavy exploration view of the data. I also handled the internal navigation, deep linking, and the loading of smaller Flash elements. The application went on to win an award from Communication Arts and was a finalist at the Adobe MAX Awards.",
